# gmea_prototype

A simple approach to performing functional class scoring on Infinium array data.

In this example we examine methylation changes in control versus lung tumour tissue,
and look at the enrichment of Reactome gene sets.

To see the results of this pipeline, see the [report](https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gmea_prototype/GSE158422_gmea.html).

This is a prototype with known limitations, so the algorithm is still under active development.
